#Made by Rolando Franqui and Connor Brown
In recent years, social media has become a big part of our daily lives; it affects how we communicate with others, our jobs and the economy. With social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter becoming extremely popular, people are allowed to express and share information that might not be necessarily accurate or merely just an opinion; however, having such a wide reach can affect many areas significantly. The goal of our research project is to see to what extent social media (specifically twitter) has affected the behavior of traders and the economy, despite being in the midst of an economic crisis. To analyze the tweets we used sentimental analysis, we will calculate the mean sentiment of the day and compare it to the adjusted close price of the S&amp;P 500 Index we used as our metric for market performance.
